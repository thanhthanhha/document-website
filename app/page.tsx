          This website is a collection of the answers that some active server members and I have for
          some of the most commonly asked questions on the server. I found myself answering these
          questions over and over again so I decided why not make something so I can simply answer
          with a URL instead.

          best to keep them up to date but that is not always possible. If you find any errors or
