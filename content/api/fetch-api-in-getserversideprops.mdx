No, this is not the right way to fetch data in `getServerSideProps` (and similar functions such as `getStaticProps`). In short, do _not_ fetch your own API routes in server environments like those functions, instead just call the server-side logic directly. Instead of the code above, you should do something like this:

```tsx
import { prisma } from "~/lib/prisma";

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: 123456 } });
  return {
    props: { user },
  };
}
```

For more information, see <Question id="fetch-api-in-rsc" /> which concerns the exact problem here but for the `app` router. Read it with "server components" as "`getServerSideProps` and similar functions" and "route handlers" as "API routes".

Basically, **if you find yourself having to fetch from `localhost:3000` in your own Next.js app** (assuming this Next.js app runs on port 3000) **and the fetch requires an absolute URL, you are very likely doing something wrong**.
