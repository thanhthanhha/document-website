The most likely cause is that you're using a case-insensitive operating system (Windows, macOS) and you have a file named, say, `SomeFile.js` and you're trying to import it as `somefile.js`. This will work on your computer but not on Vercel or other providers, because they use Linux, which is case-sensitive.

If you host your project on GitHub or similar Git hosting services, go there to check the correct capitalisation of the file path, and use it. You may also want to look up how to rename the file with `git` so that your prefered capitalisation is preserved.

_Personal opinion:_ This is why I exclusively use `kebab-case` for file and folder names now. It is probably not a popular opinion in the React community, but it's exactly because I faced this kind of problem before and want to avoid it in the future.
